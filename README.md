## :speech_balloon: Deprecated Side-Project

This repo was an attempt at designing a universal IDL (Interface
Description Language) and data format with influences from the
function programming paradigm. It was created for use with my other
project, [TaleTable](https://github.com/jeff-wise/taletable-legacy),
in order to manage large amounts of external data definitions and
configuration. Since then, I've brought a lot of insights and
lessons-learned from this project into
[Elea](https://github.com/elealang), which aims to be a different
kind of programming language. Due to its unique type system it can
function as both an IDL and data format, expanding the scope of Lulo
into use-cases that range from serialization and schema definitions
to data engineering, project management and even application design.

The [canonical
implementation](https://github.com/jeff-wise/lulo-haskell) was done
with Haskell. This version was used with the Android application.
